# Titanic Dataset Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
this project focus performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.
The dataset includes passenger information from the Titanic ship, such as whether they survived, their class, name, 
sex, age, family members, ticket information, fare, cabin, and embarkation port. The notebook aims to uncover insights about passenger survival and other patterns in the data.

## Required Libraries

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including loading data and handling data frames.

NumPy: For numerical operations and handling missing values.

Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

Seaborn: For statistical data visualization and making plots with more advanced features than Matplotlib.



## steps involving in the  Process

*  Importing data from the kaggle(downloading)
* converting the data from csv file to DataFrame with Pandas Library
* Checking the missing values and handling the missing values
* preparing  questions according the dataset and performing
* ploting Graphs based on the dataset to identifing the survival rate on Male and Female using (seaborn and matplotlib) libraries
